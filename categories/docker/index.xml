      <description>Lately I have been playing a lot with Docker. I love the whole idea of containers, how you can easily deploy processes in an isolated environment with low resource overhead. In addition, I think another big win introduced by Docker is the image concept: a hermetically sealed portable file that contains all that you need to run your process or application: binaries, dependencies and configuration. Just beautiful!
Working at MongoDB means I need to run several mongod processes every day: to test a specific feature, to demo something, configuration example, etc.</description>
